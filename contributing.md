# Contributing a presentation to the Malaga Mobile meetup

Malaga Mobile is a mobile development meetup by the community for the community.

We need YOU to make it happen.

Would you like to contribute with a presentation? Here is a guideline:

## What formats are available?

We propose the following formats:

* Lightning talk (5 min): short and focused, ideal for simple tips or hacks for every day workflows.
* Regular presentation (20-30 min): tell us about a technical idea, with examples and use cases.
* Extended presentation (30-45 min): ideal for dense topics that require lots of supporting information.
* Workshop/tutorial (45-90 min): guide attendees step by step with a live session.

Missing something? Just [propose](mailto:malagamobile@protonmail.com) another format.

## What content is accepted?

We are interested in all topics related to mobile development. That includes iOS and Android technical topics, but also design, marketing, distribution, continuous integration, testing, tooling, IoT, wearables, game development, indie development, hybrid development, etc.



## I would like to make a presentation but I am too shy

We strive to create a relaxed atmosphere that feels friendly and inclusive. Actually, presenting at a community meetup can be fun and fulfilling, because you don't have the pressure of a formal presentation or a job interview. 

It's OK to make mistakes, it's OK not to know everything there is to know about what you are presenting (spoiler alert: nobody does!), it's OK to be opinionated (as long as you are respectful to other viewpoints), it's OK to be less than perfect. 

Just get out of your shell and give it a try! 



## I would like to make a presentation but I don't have anything interesting to say

Did you ever have a eureka moment, when you found a solution to a particularly nasty problem? Did you ever rejoice at a neat new way of streamlining your team's workflow? Have you spent significant time figuring out some complex topic that bothered you?

Then you qualify to share it with the community. Simply put, if it was interesting enough for you, it will be interesting to others as well. 



## Is the language always English?

The preferred language is English, simply because that is the language of the mobile community worldwide. If you want to present something but feel uncomfortable with the English language, propose to do it in Spanish. We can accommodate almost anything!

We want to give chances to as many speakers as possible, so don't let English be a barrier to coming out and sharing with the community.



## Do you encourage diversity?

YES! We would like to make this a modern and vibrant community, so underrepresented minorities are strongly encouraged to make proposals. Let your voice be heard and contribute to redefine the landscape of the industry. You will inspire others to do the same.
